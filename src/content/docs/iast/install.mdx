<Callout variant="important">
  Run IAST with non-production deployments only. IAST tests the application by
  invoking HTTP requests with an exploit payload. You must use IAST in
  non-production environments with only simulated data to avoid both data
  corruption and introducing exploits into your live code. In addition, when you
  run IAST on new code in pre-production, you catch potential vulnerabilities
  before they go live.

## Install New Relic IAST

There are primarily five stages involved in successful installation of IAST:

1. [Safety Check](#safety-check)
2. [Selection of Application Language](#selection-of-application-language)
3. [Updating the APM Agent](#updating-the-apm-agent)
4. [Setting up the Security Agent](#setting-up-the-security-agent)
5. [Restart and test the application](#restart-and-test-the-application)

  </Step>

  <Step>
    
<Callout variant="important">
  Before you start IAST installation, review the IAST testing steps and how exploitable vulnerabilities are detected. 
  For more information, refer: [IAST exploitable vulnerabilities](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/iast/exploitable-vulns/)
</Callout>

## Safety Check

    Make sure IAST is not running in the production environment and click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.

    />

    Once you select the application language, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions and must watch the [relevant application language video](/docs/iast/install/#check-out-these-demo-videos-for-setting-up-iast-with-different-application-languages) for successful installation of IAST.

<Callout variant="caution">
  - You may encounter error if on-screen instructions are not followed properly.

## Update the APM agent

    <CollapserGroup>

    title="Update the APM agent for Java Application Language"
    >

Update the APM agent to the latest version. The minimum version supported is: v8.9.0. To update the java agent, follow these on-screen [instructions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent/) and verify the agent version using the command:

```
java -jar newrelic.jar -v

```

Click on the **Next** to setup the security agent.

    ## Setup security agent

  <CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="setup-security-agent-java"
    title="Setup security agent for java application"
  >
    
    Setup the security agent by enabling the security agent settings. Make sure your `newrelic.yml` config file is updated as follows:

    - `newrelic.yml` config file (This setting is common for EU and Fed users)

        ```yml
        security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true
        ```

    - `newrelic.yml` config file for EU

        ```yml
        security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true
            validator_service_url: wss://csec.eu01.nr-data.net
        ```
    - `newrelic.yml` config file for Fed users

        ```yml
         security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true
            validator_service_url: wss://csec-gov.nr-data.net
        ```
    
    Set the `security.enabled` and `security.agent.enabled` flag to true in the **newrelic.yml** config file. Make sure the `high_security` in **newrelic.yml** is turned off for the IAST to work.
 
    <img

      src="/images/iast-full-configuration.webp"
    />

    The code shown above for **Setup security agent** is the bare minimum requirement to start the IAST. 

    To fully configure the IAST, click on `View security config fields` and copy the **Security Config** Code. Now open the **newrelic.yml** file and paste the copied code below `high_security: false`.

<Callout variant="tip">

    `yml` is sensitive to indents and spacing, make sure the code pasted in **newrelic.yml** file is lined up underneath the high security settings:

    </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart and test the application
    
    To start testing with the IAST agent, restart your application and generate traffic against your applicationâ€™s APIs. Click <DNT>**See your data**</DNT> for an overview of your tested application.

  </Step>

  <Step>

    ## Test application window

    The below screen will show IAST test results as per your configurations.
