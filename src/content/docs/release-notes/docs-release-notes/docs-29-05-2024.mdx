### New docs

* [Logging with the iOS agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/ios-remote-logging/) introduces enhanced logging capabilities in the iOS agent, including log level configuration and automatic log collection features.
* The [Kubernetes APM auto-attach](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-agent-operator), formerly known as the Kubernetes agent operator, now streamlines full-stack observability for Kubernetes environments by automating APM instrumentation alongside Kubernetes agent deployment.

### Major changes

* Updated the version support information (under prerequisites section) about the [service broker for TAS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/other-infrastructure-integrations/cloudfoundry-integrations/vmware-tanzu-service-broker-integration/).
* The [synthetic job manager](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager/) now supports Podman container environment.
* There is an update about [Node.js agent compatibility](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/).   
* We have deprecated the Snowflake integration with New Relic. Refer the [topic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/snowflake-integration/) to understand on usage of Snowflake.

### Minor changes

* [Updated the End of Life support date](https://docs.newrelic.com/eol/2024/04/eol-04-24-24-polling-api/) for Azure SQL database. Azure is deprecating the SDK the polling API uses and will no longer be providing critical updates to this API, creating security concerns moving forward.
{/* * [We do not support all the Azure resources for Azure Monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/).  */}
* The ruby agent has added [support for multiple new message broker gems](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-requirements-supported-frameworks/). 
* In [EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery]((https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/build-nr-ui/sdk-component/query-and-storage/EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery/)), `sortBy` attribute is replaced by `sortType` for fetching sorting criteria. 
* Updated [Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent).
