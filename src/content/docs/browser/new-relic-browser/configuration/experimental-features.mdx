New Relic Browser features are exposed to customers in a controlled manner to ensure stability and reliability. However, some features are made available before they reach general availability. These are known as experimental features. To access them, you must opt in.

## Current experimental features

The following experimental features are available in New Relic Browser:
* Browser Agent v1.272.0 - [Automatically track native marks and measures as `BrowserPerformance` events](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/marks-and-measures).
* Browser Agent v1.276.0 - [Automatically observe page resource assets as `BrowserPerformance` events](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/page-resources).


<Callout variant="important">
  Experimental features are available only for opt-in on manual copy and paste, or NPM implementations of the agent. These features are subject to change and should be used with caution.
</Callout>

## Opt in to use experimental features

### Browser Performance - Marks, Measures & Resources
1. Ensure you are using a version of the New Relic Browser agent compatible with the experimental feature, on a pro or pro+spa equivalent build.
2. Find the New Relic browser agent code in your webpage HTML or JS application.
3. In the `init` configuration object, add the `performance` feature configuration. Here's an example that enables both marks and measures detection:
  ```js
  <script type="text/javascript"> ;window.NREUM||(NREUM={});init={ â€¦, performance: {
    capture_marks: true, // enable to capture browser performance marks (default false)
    capture_measures: true // enable to capture browser performance measures (default false)
    resources: {
      enabled: true, // enable to capture browser peformance resource timings (default false)
      asset_types: [], // Asset types to collect -- an empty array will collect all types (default []). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/initiatorType for the list of types.
      first_party_domains: [], // when included, will decorate any resource as a first party resource if matching (default [])
      ignore_newrelic: true // ignore capturing internal agent scripts and harvest calls (default true)
    }
  } }:
  ```
4. Deploy your app.
